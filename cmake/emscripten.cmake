# CMake toolchain file for building ucode for WebAssembly (wasm32) with

#   cmake -B build-wasm -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/emscripten.cmake

# Requires an activated emsdk environment (emcc on PATH). Produces
# libucode.a and ucode-modules.a for static linking into an embedder's
# executable; see the UCODE_WASM section of CMakeLists.txt.
#
# Note: the dependency setup (json-c, libmd) cannot live in this file --
# toolchain files are re-included by every try_compile() probe build --
# so CMakeLists.txt pulls in cmake/emscripten-deps.cmake when it detects
# the emscripten compiler.
